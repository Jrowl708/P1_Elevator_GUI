Issues with the Current Design
-
-The panel includes both a G button for the ground floor and a 1 for the first floor, which is sure to cause confusion with users

-There are 2 sets of open and close buttons. Again, this is sure to confuse users pertaining to the functionality of those buttons

-No buttons contain auditory feedback

Why the Design is Bad
-
-There are too many buttons that may potentially confuse the user

-This conventional design has not evolved

Common Uses
-
-Travelling to different floors

-Allowing those with disabilities to have easier access to other floors

-Pressing buttons that correlate to a desired floor

Rare Uses
-
-Touchscreen panels are pretty rare

-Emergency stop button

-Alarm/Help button

Does My Interface Make Those Common Things Easier?
-
-It doesn't necessarily make it easier, but the button grouping and lack of similar buttons makes it easier to recognize their functionality

Common Sequence of Actions
-
-Upon entering an elevator, people tend to immediately press the button that correlates to their desired floor

-Some users will press the close door button right after that in hopes that it actually works without delay

-Users then wait for the elevator to take them to that floor, then exit the elevator

How Does the Elevator Support the User to Figure Out How to Make it Work?
-
-Typically button placement and visual feedback from the button (light) are what show the users how to use the elevator

How Does the Elevator Provide Feedback to the User?
-
-The floor that they have selected will be highlighted in some way, indicating to them that the button has been pressed

-Auditory beeps tell the user they have arrived, or the user will feel the elevator stop and the doors open automatically

-Some elevators have a screen that shows what floors they are passing through as well

What Common Mistakes Can You Make With This Current Design?
-
-Users may get the G button and 1 button confused 

-Same can be said for the 2 sets of open and close buttons on this particular panel

-Overcrowding the panel with buttons that have multiple functions can cause confusion and be visually unappealing
